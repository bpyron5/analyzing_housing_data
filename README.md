## Problem Statement
Can sale prices for houses in Ames, Iowa be predicted accurately using the data provided by the Ames Assessor's Office?

## Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to construct a model that successfully predicts sale prices for houses in Ames, Iowa using the data provided. The hope is to do so using as competitive a model as possible.

The resulting model performs well here and scores well in the kaggle competition based off the same data. Though outliers are present, their effect in this case on the success of the model is largely inconsequential.

It is concluded that the data provided is in fact useful for predicting house sale prices in Ames, Iowa, and that this is accomplished particularly well using the the model produced here. It is recommended that those responsible for future data collection be especially mindful about overall house quality as it is the single most effective feature in predicting sale price.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The model performed well here and scored well in the kaggle competition based off the same data. Though outliers were present, their effect in this case on the success of the model was largely inconsequential.    

It is concluded that the data provided is in fact useful for predicting house sale prices in Ames, Iowa, and that this is accomplished particularly well using the the model produced here.
